#Task 1 

#In this task its asking me to take both user name and age and print them 
#To do so I made two variable one for name and one for age and used the input() command 
#Then I printed them both out
#Next its asking me to print out Hello World! in a new line 
#To get a new line I use the characters "\n" in the print() function
#This will make a newline and print out the string Hello World!

user_name = input("What is your name?" )
user_age = input("How old are you?" )
print(user_name)
print(user_age) 
print("\n Hello World!")
